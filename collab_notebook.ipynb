External Library Linking**: A multi-file C project was created, comprising a header file (`.h`), a library source file (`.c`), and a main program (`main.c`). These were compiled into an object file (`.o`) and then linked together to form a final executable, demonstrating how to use and link external libraries.\n","\n","Guidance on compiling with external libraries involves:\n","*   **Header Files (`.h`)**: Define function prototypes and macros that can be included in other source files.\n","*   **Source Files (`.c`)**: Implement the functions declared in header files.\n","*   **Compiling to Object Files**: Use `gcc -c <source_file.c> -o <object_file.o>` to compile individual source files into object files without linking them yet. This is useful for libraries.\n","*   **Linking Object Files**: When compiling your main program, include the object files (`.o`) along with your main source file to link them into a single executable. For example, `gcc main.c my_library.o -o my_program`.\n","*   **Linking System Libraries**: For standard system libraries (e.g., `math` library), use the `-l` flag, such as `gcc main.c -lm -o my_program`.\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","*   The `build-essential` package, including GCC version 11.4.0, was successfully installed and verified, establishing the core C development tools.\n","*   A \"Hello, World!\" C program was successfully created, compiled using `gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world`, and executed, producing the expected \"Hello, World!\" output.\n","*   The process successfully demonstrated linking external C code: a `my_library.c` file was compiled into an object file `my_library.o` using `gcc -c my_library.c -o my_library.o`, and then linked with `main.c` to create a final executable `my_program` using `gcc main.c my_library.o -o my_program`.\n","*   The execution of `my_program` produced: \"Hello from main!\\\\nLibrary message: This is a message from the external library.\", confirming successful integration and function calls across separate source files.\n","*   A recurring technical detail observed was the necessity for the `%%writefile` magic command to be on the very first line of its cell to avoid `SyntaxError`.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","*   The established C development environment in Google Colab is fully functional for compiling and linking multi-file C projects, making it suitable for educational purposes or prototyping C applications without a local setup.\n","*   Further exploration could involve demonstrating the use of `makefiles` for managing compilation of larger C projects with multiple dependencies, or integrating more complex external libraries that require specific linking flags.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"af44062b"},"source":["# Task\n","## Install GDAL Development Libraries\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Install the `libgdal-dev` package, which provides the header files and static libraries necessary for compiling C programs that use GDAL functions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"c2461b54"},"source":["## Install GDAL Development Libraries\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Install the `libgdal-dev` package, which provides the header files and static libraries necessary for compiling C programs that use GDAL functions.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6d8c7d11"},"source":["**Reasoning**:\n","To install the `libgdal-dev` package, I need to execute shell commands using `apt-get` to first update the package lists and then install the required development libraries.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"31c78e86","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767636861317,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":7574,"user":{"displayName":"john rossi","userId":"10023393882298360254"}},"outputId":"1431f1cb-72a2-42cc-a1d9-da01147f3f61"},"source":["print('Updating package lists and installing libgdal-dev...')\n","!apt-get update && apt-get install -y libgdal-dev\n","print('libgdal-dev installation complete.')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Updating package lists and installing libgdal-dev...\n","Get:1 https://cli.github.com/packages stable InRelease [3,917 B]\n","Get:2 https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu jammy-cran40/ InRelease [3,632 B]\n","Hit:3 https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/deadsnakes/ppa/ubuntu jammy InRelease\n","Hit:4 https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/ubuntugis/ppa/ubuntu jammy InRelease\n","Hit:5 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security InRelease\n","Hit:6 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy InRelease\n","Hit:7 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-updates InRelease\n","Hit:8 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-backports InRelease\n","Hit:9 https://r2u.stat.illinois.edu/ubuntu jammy InRelease\n","Fetched 7,549 B in 1s (5,345 B/s)\n","Reading package lists...

It defined a target GeoTIFF raster of 200x200 pixels covering Australia's geographic extent (\\min_lon=110.0, \\max_lon=155.0, \\min_lat=-45.0, \\max_lat=-10.0) with a WGS84 projection.\n","    *   The program initialized the raster band with a background value of 0.0 and used `GDALRasterizeLayers` with the `BURN=1` option to set pixels covered by ADM1 features to a value of 1.\n","    *   **Persistent Issue:** Despite multiple iterations of debugging, including correcting API calls (e.g., `OGROpen`, `GDALRasterizeLayers`), resolving type-casting issues, adding explicit `GDALFlushCache` calls, and enabling verbose `CPL_DEBUG` logging, the C++ program consistently produced a 0-byte GeoTIFF file (`aus_adm1_raster.tif`) that `gdalinfo` failed to recognize as a valid format. No explicit GDAL errors were reported by `CPLGetLastErrorMsg()` during these failures.\n","*   **Successful Rasterization via Command-Line Tool:** To isolate the problem, the equivalent rasterization task was executed successfully using the `gdal_rasterize` command-line utility. This confirmed that the GDAL library and environment were correctly installed and functional, and the input data was valid. The command `gdal_rasterize -a_nodata 0 -burn 1 -ts 200 200 -te 110.0 -45.0 155.0 -10.0 -co \"COMPRESS=DEFLATE\" -co \"TILED=YES\" -ot Byte \"/vsizip/gadm41_AUS_shp.zip/gadm41_AUS_1.shp\" gdal_rasterize_output.tif` produced a valid `gdal_rasterize_output.tif`.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","*   The inability of the C++ program to write a valid GeoTIFF despite reporting success and providing no specific error messages indicates a subtle, unidentified bug in the custom C++ code's interaction with the GDAL API's file writing or finalization mechanisms. This could be related to resource management or buffer handling that isn't surfacing through standard GDAL error reporting.\n","*   For future development with GDAL in C++, it is recommended to validate the environment and expected output using robust command-line tools like `gdal_rasterize` early in the process. If a custom program fails, systematically comparing its behavior with that of the command-line tools can help pinpoint the exact point of failure. A deeper dive with a C++ debugger might be necessary to trace the execution flow within GDAL's `GDALClose` or `FlushCache` calls for `aus_adm1_raster.tif`.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"d970b05b"},"source":["# Task\n","Change the C++ program `rasterize_aus.cpp` to output a PNG file instead of GeoTIFF, and then recompile and execute it.
